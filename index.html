Please take appropriate steps to secure them, such as storing them in encrypted locations or restricting access to trusted individuals only.</p>
    <p>The developer of Health ToGo cannot be held responsible for any unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of exported data once it leaves the app. By using the export feature, you acknowledge and accept full responsibility for the protection and management of your exported files.</p>
